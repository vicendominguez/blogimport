blogimport Groq
==========

ü§ñ **Update** vicendominguez: 

* I've added some sugar using a Groq AI to improve my posts and some issues.
* The request rate to Groq is shit. I am in the free tier.
* This is Fast-and-fourious code, my objetive is to move my blog. Sorry.
* It checks if the files previosly exist and it skips to do the job for that file again.

 ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note!! I've created an ollama flavor version in the branch `sugarollama`

Blogimport is a simple tool to convert Blogger's xml export data into
[Hugo](http://hugo.spf13.com)-friendly markdown format.

The tool is really basic, you just pass it the name of the file you're
converting, the directory in which to output the markdown files, and optionally
a piece of metadata to add to each of the posts' frontmatter (which must be a
single line of valid toml, such as -extra="type = \"oldPost\"").

Blogimport outputs the tags, the post title, the published date, and whether or
not it's a draft as standard Hugo frontmatter.  In addition, the updated date is
added, as well as author name and uri, and an additional value of blogimport =
true (which can be handy for having special handling in your Hugo templates for
imported posts).

Finally, the original HTML content is ouput as the main content of the markdown
file.  Note that no processing is done on the content... HTML is valid markdown,
and it's probably best not to muck with it, so blogimport doesn't touch it.

Here's a typical frontmatter output:

	+++
	title = "My cool title"
	date = 2014-07-09T17:43:00Z
	updated = 2014-07-22T07:11:52Z
	tags = ["Hugo", "is", "awesome"]
	draft = true
	blogimport = true 
	[author]
		name = "Nate Finch"
		uri = "https://plus.google.com/115818189328363361527"
	+++

Note that only toml output is supported now.  If you want to support something
else, feel free to make a pull request.  I set up the code to be pretty easy to
update to output other formats.
